# Introduction

QueryStar is the easiest way for data and Python developers to ship AI-powered bots. It provides an easy way to set up trigger and actions, so you can focus on the most value-added part: **Do Something with Your Own Data**.

## Who is QueryStar built for

-   Data teams, Python developers, and petty much everyone who can write basic Python 🐍.

-   If you happen to use [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit), [PyWebIO](https://github.com/pywebio/PyWebIO) , [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio), [Greppo](https://github.com/greppo-io/greppo): **QueryStar is like them, but to build bots, instead of web UI**.

    > 😋 _We're actually the creators behind `PyWebIO` and `Greppo`_

-   If you happen to know some workflow automation web tools like `Zapier`, `Pipedream`, `Workato`, the big differentiator is: **QueryStar allows you to build entire workflows as a single Python file**. Benefits:

    -   No more clicking buttons and connecting blocks on web canvas.
    -   Easy integration with internal codebase, algorithms, and libraries.
    -   No need to abandon your favorite Dev tools.

    > 😈 _We believe visual editors can diminish developer's creativity_

## QueryStar under the hood

There are 2 parts:

-   A low code open source Python SDK to help you:
    -   Transform your LLM functions to production-ready bots
    -   Pre-built AI modules to support various use cases, such as QA services.
-   A cloud service that help you:
    -   Deploy bots
    -   Manage their authorization and authentication
    -   Monitor performance.

## Main Features

### QueryStar Python SDK

A common usage pattern:
Two function calls to ship Python scripts as a bot, at scale.

```python
# bot.py: Demonstrating a common usage pattern

import querystar as qs
import langchain, llama_index, pandas  # or your favorite libraries

# Every time a new message is sent to Slack,
message = qs.triggers.slack.new_message(channel_id, trigger_string)

# Bot is triggered to processes the following script
response = ...

# then, sends answer back to Slack
qs.actions.slack.add_message(channel_id, text=response)
```

🤩 That's it! Clean code scales your bots and creativity.

:::tip
QueryStar takes care all other energy-draining BS for you.

-   Secret and scope management is made easy. No more config files sent to different places.
-   No need to worry about rate limit, time out, async call etc.
-   Learn unified QueryStar APIs then automate many SaaS tools.

### QueryStar Workspaces (Cloud)

<Image img={require("./add-integration.png")} />

In the Workspace, you can:

-   Adding integration to Slack
-   Generating QueryStar token: one token for all integrated SaaS tools
-   More coming soon:
    -   Deploying
    -   Managing
    -   Monitoring

## How to get started

Follow `Quickstart` to make your first Slack bot within just a few (~10) minutes.

-   The first 2 sections normally take 2 and 1 min respectively.
-   Then, coding begins. We will be developing a bot that
    -   Triggered by new messages sent to channel `#introduction`.
    -   Send a message back to the channel to say `Hello`.

More advanced tutorials can be found in `Tutorials`.
